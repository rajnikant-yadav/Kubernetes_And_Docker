# GitHub Actions Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to automate tasks in your GitHub repository. Here's an overview of the main components:

## Workflow

A workflow is a series of tasks you want to automate. For example, you can create a workflow that builds and tests your code whenever someone pushes changes to your GitHub repository.

```yaml
name: Build and Test
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Add more steps for building and testing
```
## Job
Each task within your workflow is a job. Jobs can run one after the other or at the same time. For instance, building your code and running tests can be separate jobs in your workflow.
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Add more steps for building
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Add more steps for testing
```
